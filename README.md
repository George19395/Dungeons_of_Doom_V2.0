# Dungeons of Doom_V2.0
 
Dungeons of Doom_V2.0 is the extension of the university project Dungeons of Doom which is in the repositort Dungeons of Doom.
Dungeons of doom_V2.0 was extended to have better UI and also be able to be deployed globally. 
The server side of the application no longer displays the GODS_EYE map which was was used to show the full game including all the players and resources. This was done due to the fact
  that many games can be created in this version which players can use the code of the game to join their friends game globally.
  The game was hosted by me as a test on an AWS_EC2 machine and friends from around the world were able to join and test it out with me as it was packaged and dispatched as an exe.
  2 exe files where produced. One for the server and one which is the game players actually run.
